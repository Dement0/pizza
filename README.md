# Pizza

A pizza restaurant management system.

- [x] Users can see all the menu on the `index` page.
- [x] Users can see the details of any pizza on the menu providing the `id`. Ex: `/3`
- [x] Using Django Admin, site administrators (restaurant owners) should be able to add, update, and remove items on the menu.
- [x] Customers are able to register, login and logout of the website.
- [ ] Once logged in, users should see a representation of the restaurant’s menu, where they can add items (along with toppings or extras, if appropriate) to their virtual “shopping cart.” The contents of the shopping should be saved even if a user closes the window, or logs out and logs back in again.
